    <h2 style="color:#a67c52;">What if I find a recipe error?</h2>
    <p>If you notice a discrepancy between the recipe image and the text recipe, please <a href="mailto:recipeerror@bwalter.org?subject=Recipe Error&body=Please describe the issue you found with the recipe.">send us an email</a>. Include the recipe name, cook's name, and a description of the issue.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style="color:#a67c52;">How was this recipe text created?</h2>
    <p>The recipe name, ingredients, and instructions were extracted using advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology directly from the original recipe image. This ensures the authenticity of these key fields.</p>
    <p>Other fields—such as description, notes, meta, and comments—were generated or enhanced using AI. The AI analyzes the recipe image and text to provide emphasis, clarification, highlight issues, share interesting facts, and offer modern explanations for items that may no longer be mainstream.</p>
    <p><strong>Most important for authenticity:</strong> The <span style="color:#a67c52;">name</span>, <span style="color:#a67c52;">ingredients</span>, and <span style="color:#a67c52;">instructions</span> are direct from the original recipe. The other fields are included to enrich your experience and understanding, but may reflect AI interpretation.</p>
